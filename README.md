====================================================

**How I have Managed State on this App**

I have use useState Hook to manage the state of this app or manage the local component state.
I have use  useState to set Data Fetching and Asynchronous State Updates and also for set totalPrice, totalPrice, remainingCredit etc.
I have some nested component like Courses and Course so I use  State Lifting and Prop Drilling to send data to the Nested Component.
That's it
